The code implement (link:[Miracle1207/Cache at 0414-cache-conference-final (github.com)](https://github.com/Miracle1207/Cache/tree/0414-cache-conference-final)) of the paper " Joint Caching and Transmission in the Mobile Edge Network: An Multi-Agent Learning Approach"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9685590.



## Train

```python
python Cache/maddpg_pytorch/main.py
```

You can change args in main.py and change algorithms in [Cache](https://github.com/Miracle1207/Cache/tree/0414-cache-conference-final)/[gym_cache](https://github.com/Miracle1207/Cache/tree/0414-cache-conference-final/gym_cache)/**envs**/[DataRate.py](https://github.com/Miracle1207/Cache/blob/0414-cache-conference-final/gym_cache/envs/DataRate.py). 

## Plot

```
python Cache/maddpg_pytorch/plot.py
```

You can change data set in plot.py.
